# Ethan Lam

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 
## Vibe!
In depths of screen-lit midnight, fingers dance,  
Across the keys like rain on quiet leaves,  
While logic flows in streams of circumstance,  
And code unfolds what dreaming mind conceives.  

The cursor blinks a rhythm, soft and true,  
As functions nest like birds within their trees,  
Each bracket closed, each loop begins anew,  
While debugging whispers through the evening breeze.  

In zones where time dissolves and hours blend,  
The programmer and program become one,  
Where syntax sings and algorithms transcend  
The mundane world beneath the setting sun.  

*So let the vibe of coding take its hold,*  
*Where digital dreams in silicon unfold.*
